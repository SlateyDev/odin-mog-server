# MOG-SERVER

A start on making a multiplayer online game server in odin

This currently has no real functionality and is the beginning of a test

Implemented:
* SRP6 Server/Client Authentication Handshake
* SQLite database creation with automatic migrations
* ENet RUDP communication
* User creation into DB (set create_test_user to true in game-server/main.odin)
